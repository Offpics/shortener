## Overview

Short URLs are generated by extracting first 7 characters of the MD5 hash of given URL.
Original URL and short URL are stored in a single database table.
This allows storing around 78 billion (36^7) URLs in the database.
In case of a collision it tries to extract next 7 characters and in really rare cases it will generate new MD5 hash with salt added to URL. Current version allows only links with protocols like'http', 'https', and also links with no protocol.

### Thoughts

- With a lot of URLs in the database, the current algorithm of generating shorts would be really inefficient. There are a lot of options to tackle this problem. For example, we could use base64 or base62 encoding to generate unique short URLs with more possible characters, which would result in more possible combinations of short URLs.

- To avoid spambots consider adding CAPTCHA defense.
